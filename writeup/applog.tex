\section{Appendix G: Progress Log}

This log details the progress of my dissertation through its final few weeks. The purpose of the log is to provide evidence of the work that has applied to the task, just in case the worse should happen (such as all the departmental servers melting at the same time as my laptop explodes, setting fire to all printed documents in the vicinity).

I think its fair to say that as Deliverables 1 \& 2 are now a matter of record. These in themselves provide adequate evidence of work achieved over the earlier sections of the project.

(Each day's entries were written as I was working, so the tenses may fluctuate between past, present and future!)
