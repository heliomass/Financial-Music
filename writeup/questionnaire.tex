\section{Appendix D: Questionnaire}

In this section, I have included the questionnaires that were used by the expert and the testers to provide feedback for the evaluation. These questionnaires were provided to the testers as Microsoft Word templates. The boxes could be ticked directly, and the music sequences were embedded in the document. Once the questionnaires were filled out, they could simply be saved under a different file name, and were then archived for later analysis.
